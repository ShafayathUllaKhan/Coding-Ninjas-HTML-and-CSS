position

1.static
2.relative
3.absolute
4.fixed
5.sticky

Ahhh 👍 this is a very good doubt — and it’s a classic CSS confusion. Let’s clear it cleanly and precisely.

Short answer (core idea)

height: 100% only works if the parent has a defined height

So:

body { height: 100% } ❌ alone is NOT enough

html, body { height: 100% } ✅ works

Now the WHY (important part)
🔹 CSS height is relative to the parent

When you write:

body {
  height: 100%;
}


CSS asks:

“100% of what?”

👉 The parent of body is html

But by default:

html {
  height: auto;  /* content-based */
}


So CSS cannot calculate 100%.

❌ Result: body height collapses to content height only.

Why this works ✅
html, body {
  height: 100%;
}

What happens now:

html → gets 100% of viewport

body → gets 100% of html

Now absolute children can correctly use height: 100%

✔ Chain is complete
✔ Browser can calculate height

Why position: relative does NOT help
body {
  position: relative;
  height: 100%;
}


❗ position: relative does NOT define height
It only changes how top/left and absolute children behave.

So browser still sees:

body height = 100% of html
html height = auto ❌


Hence → fails

Think of it like a ladder 🪜
viewport
  ↓
html (must have height)
  ↓
body (100% of html)
  ↓
#overlay (100% of body)


If any rung is missing, the ladder breaks.

Interview-level one-liner 🧠

height: 100% works only when every parent up the tree has a defined height.

BONUS TIP (real projects)

Most devs avoid this entirely and just do:

#overlay {
  position: fixed;
  inset: 0;
}


No height chain. No headache. 😄
